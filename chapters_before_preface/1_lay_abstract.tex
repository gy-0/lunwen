The project aims at creating a system that will transform handwritten text to a visually appealing image. Handwritten text on an image is first analyzed and its quality is enhanced, ready for further recognition in the software. Using a custom-trained Tesseract OCR model, the software extracts the textual content. The recognized text is then passed to a large language model, ChatGPT, which refines the text and generates creative prompts suitable for image generation. Eventually, a local image generation model based on  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generates photorealistic images matching refined prompts. This system bridges handwriting, language, and image synthesis and demonstrates the workflow through which visual ideas can be transcribed from handwritten characters to photorealistic images. The project could be applied to creative content generation, personalized art, and making AI-driven design tools more accessible to wider audiences.
