I hereby certify that this thesis represents my own work and contains no material that has been submitted previously, in whole or in part, for a degree at this or any other institution. The research presented herein was conducted independently under the supervision of my advisor.

All sources of information, including published works, unpublished materials, and personal communications, have been properly acknowledged and referenced. The experimental work, system implementation, and analysis presented in this thesis are the result of my own efforts, with appropriate attribution given to collaborative contributions and open-source resources utilized in the development process.

The custom OCR models, prompt optimization algorithms, and system architecture described in this work represent original contributions to the field of multimodal AI systems. While building upon existing foundations such as Tesseract OCR, GPT-OSS-20B, and FLUX 1.1 Pro Ultra, the integration methodologies, performance optimizations, and evaluation frameworks constitute novel research contributions.

This thesis has been prepared in accordance with the academic integrity policies of the institution and adheres to the ethical standards of research in artificial intelligence and computer science.
