\chapter{Background}

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence have led to significant developments in text recognition, natural language processing, and image generation. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has transitioned from traditional rule-based methods to deep learning-driven approaches, with Tesseract being a prominent open-source engine. The integration of machine learning techniques into Tesseract has enhanced text extraction accuracy. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the gpt-oss series, have advanced text generation and understanding. Generative models like FLUX are redefining the capabilities of image synthesis. This chapter provides an overview of these technologies, their development, and their applications.

\section{Optical Character Recognition (OCR)}
\subsection{Overview of OCR}
OCR, a field within computer vision and artificial intelligence, is the automated identification of text from images and scanned documents. OCR plays a vital role in digitizing printed and handwritten text, which facilitates document digitization, automated data entry, and the development of accessibility software for the visually impaired. The evolution of OCR has progressed from template matching and statistical modeling to modern deep learning-based methods that achieve high accuracy and robustness.

Early OCR systems relied on pattern recognition, where characters were identified using predefined templates based on their shape and structure. The advent of machine learning, particularly deep learning, caused a paradigm shift, enabling models to learn features directly from data rather than relying on manual feature engineering.

A typical modern OCR pipeline consists of multiple stages: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and post-processing. Pre-processing enhances input image quality through noise removal, binarization, and geometric normalization. Segmentation divides an image into characters or words for recognition. Feature extraction, whether conventional or deep learning-based, is critical for distinguishing text from background artifacts. Finally, classification is performed using models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or a combination thereof, to identify text content with high precision.

\subsection{The Tesseract OCR Engine}

Tesseract is a widely used open-source OCR engine, originally developed by Hewlett-Packard and subsequently open-sourced by Google. It has undergone substantial evolution, incorporating advanced machine learning techniques to improve recognition accuracy and performance. Tesseract's support for multiple languages and scripts makes it a versatile tool for diverse OCR applications.

The core architecture of Tesseract involves several processing steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Image Pre-processing:} Tesseract performs adaptive thresholding, noise removal, and skew correction to prepare the input image for analysis. This step is crucial for enhancing text visibility and minimizing artifacts that could impede recognition.
    
    \item \textbf{Page Layout Analysis:} The engine employs a page segmentation algorithm to identify text regions within a document, differentiating between text, images, and tables for precise recognition.
    
    \item \textbf{Character Segmentation:} After identifying text regions, Tesseract segments words and characters using connected component analysis and contour detection. This step ensures proper alignment and separation of characters.
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction and Recognition:} Tesseract uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network for text recognition. The LSTM model processes character sequences, capturing contextual dependencies to improve accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Post-processing:} To refine results, Tesseract applies language modeling and dictionary-based correction. These techniques help mitigate misclassification errors and improve output quality.
\end{enumerate}

Tesseract supports multiple output formats, including plain text, searchable PDFs, and structured formats like XML and HOCR. It also provides parameters to fine-tune recognition for specific application requirements, such as character whitelisting/blacklisting, engine modes, and page segmentation modes.

\subsubsection{Training Custom Tesseract Models}

While Tesseract provides pre-trained models for many languages, custom models can be trained to enhance accuracy for domain-specific applications. The training process involves the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection:} A diverse and representative dataset of text images is collected, covering variations in font styles, sizes, and image conditions.
    
    \item \textbf{Annotation:} The collected images are labeled with corresponding ground-truth text. This can be done using Tesseract's training tools or third-party annotation software.
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction and Training:} Using Tesseract's training utilities, features are extracted, and the neural network is trained to learn character patterns and sequences.
    
    \item \textbf{Evaluation and Optimization:} Post-training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess accuracy. Fine-tuning and data augmentation techniques can be employed to optimize performance.
\end{enumerate}

Training a custom Tesseract model can lead to improved performance in specialized domains, such as medical document processing, historical document digitization, and industrial automation.

\subsubsection{Integration with Other Technologies}

Tesseract's capabilities can be extended through integration with other technologies. For instance, combining OCR with Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables intelligent text analysis, such as entity recognition and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, integration with image processing libraries like OpenCV allows for advanced pre-processing to improve OCR results.

Tesseract can also be deployed in cloud-based solutions, leveraging scalable computing resources to process large volumes of documents efficiently. Major cloud providers offer OCR services that incorporate Tesseract alongside proprietary algorithms.

\subsubsection{Challenges and Future Directions}

Despite its capabilities, Tesseract faces challenges, including handling low-quality images, recognizing cursive handwriting, and supporting complex scripts. Ongoing research in deep learning, particularly with transformer-based models and generative approaches, aims to address these limitations.

Future advancements in OCR are expected to include real-time processing, expanded multilingual recognition, and automated error correction, further enhancing the utility of OCR systems across various domains.

\section{gpt-oss-20b and Large Language Models}

gpt-oss-20b is an open-weight large language model from the gpt-oss series, which also includes the larger gpt-oss-120b. It is a decoder-only Transformer with approximately 21 billion parameters, utilizing a mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing mechanism that activates about 3.6 billion parameters per token. Released under the Apache-2.0 license, it is designed for low-latency, local, or specialized deployments \cite{openai2025gptoss}. The model is optimized for reasoning and agentic use cases, supports function calling with structured outputs, and can be served on commodity GPUs when quantized.

\subsection{Architecture of gpt-oss-20b}

gpt-oss-20b employs a decoder-only Transformer architecture augmented with MoE routing to increase throughput and reduce active computation per token. Input text is converted into token embeddings, with positional information added to preserve sequence order for the attention mechanism. Stacked self-attention layers with multiple heads capture long-range dependencies, while position-wise feed-forward networks increase representational capacity. Residual connections and normalization layers are used to stabilize optimization. The MoE router selects a subset of experts for each token, resulting in approximately 3.6B active parameters at inference from a total of 21B. This design improves the latency-quality trade-off. For inference, the "Harmony" response format is recommended to standardize function calling and structured outputs \cite{openai2025gptoss}.

\subsection{Pre-training, Alignment, and Adaptation}

The model is pre-trained on diverse text corpora using causal next-token prediction to develop broad linguistic and reasoning capabilities. Subsequent alignment involves supervised fine-tuning and human feedback to improve helpfulness, safety, and instruction adherence while preserving tool-use functions. A configurable reasoning effort allows users to balance latency and reasoning depth. Post-training MXFP4 quantization of MoE weights enables gpt-oss-20b to operate within approximately 16GB of memory without significant quality degradation, facilitating local deployment. The open-weight license permits further adaptation via supervised fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks. Prompts should adhere to the Harmony chat template to ensure robust function calling and structured outputs \cite{openai2025gptoss}.

\subsection{Capabilities and Applications}

In practice, gpt-oss-20b demonstrates strong performance in text generation, editing, code completion, and long-form content summarization. Through structured outputs and function calling, it integrates with external tools, retrieval systems, and APIs to support agentic workflows. The MoE architecture and quantization make the model suitable for deployments with latency and memory constraints, while fine-tuning allows for specialization \cite{openai2025gptoss}.
