\chapter{Introduction}

The convergence of optical character recognition, natural language processing, and generative artificial intelligence has created unprecedented opportunities for developing intelligent content transformation systems. As digital information continues to proliferate across various formats and mediums, the ability to automatically extract textual content from images and transform it into contextually appropriate visual representations has become increasingly valuable across numerous domains, including document processing, accessibility technologies, and creative content generation.

This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an integrated system that combines custom-trained Tesseract OCR models, image preprocessing techniques, and state-of-the-art AI-driven image generation to create a comprehensive text-to-image transformation pipeline. The system addresses the fundamental challenge of bridging the semantic gap between extracted textual content and meaningful visual outputs while maintaining high accuracy, processing efficiency, and user accessibility throughout the entire workflow.

\section{Problem Statement and Motivation}

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to remarkable progress in individual domains such as optical character recognition, natural language understanding, and image synthesis. However, the integration of these technologies into cohesive systems that can seamlessly transform textual information extracted from images into contextually relevant visual outputs remains a significant technical and research challenge. Traditional approaches often suffer from several critical limitations that impede their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Contemporary OCR systems, while achieving acceptable accuracy on clean, well-formatted text, frequently encounter substantial difficulties when processing handwritten content, low-quality images, or documents with complex layouts and varying fonts. The accuracy degradation in such scenarios significantly impacts the quality of downstream processing tasks. Research by Esser et al. \cite{esser2020improving} demonstrates that even state-of-the-art OCR engines like Tesseract 4.0 can benefit from specialized preprocessing techniques, achieving up to 359\% relative improvement in character-level accuracy through convolution-based preprocessing methods.

Furthermore, the raw output from OCR engines often lacks the semantic richness and contextual understanding required for effective transformation into visual content. The extracted text typically contains recognition errors, formatting inconsistencies, and lacks the descriptive elements necessary for generating meaningful visual representations. This gap between raw OCR output and usable prompts for image generation necessitates sophisticated natural language processing capabilities.

The emergence of large language models has revolutionized text processing and understanding capabilities. OpenAI's recent release of GPT-OSS-20B \cite{openai2025gptoss}, an open-source model with 21 billion parameters utilizing mixture-of-experts architecture, provides new opportunities for local deployment of advanced language processing capabilities. The model's ability to run efficiently on consumer hardware with only 16GB memory requirements makes it particularly suitable for privacy-preserving applications that require local processing.

Simultaneously, the field of text-to-image generation has witnessed remarkable advances with the introduction of models such as FLUX by Black Forest Labs \cite{blackforestlabs2024flux}. These diffusion-based models demonstrate unprecedented capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual descriptions, incorporating advanced architectural innovations such as flow matching and parallel attention mechanisms \cite{rombach2025flux}.

The increasing demand for multimodal AI systems that can process and integrate information across different modalities has been well-documented in recent comprehensive surveys \cite{qin2024comprehensive, jin2024mm}. However, the practical implementation of such systems that effectively combine OCR, language processing, and image generation remains an active area of research with significant opportunities for innovation and improvement.

\section{Research Objectives}

The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive system that effectively integrates custom-trained OCR technology, intelligent image preprocessing, natural language processing, and AI-driven image generation to create a robust and practical text-to-image transformation pipeline. This overarching goal is supported by several specific research objectives that address key technical challenges in multimodal AI system development.

First, this work aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of text extraction from diverse image sources through the development and optimization of custom Tesseract OCR models. This objective encompasses the creation of specialized training datasets, implementation of domain-specific preprocessing algorithms, and systematic optimization of model parameters to achieve superior performance across different content types, handwriting styles, and image quality conditions. The custom training approach enables domain-specific optimization that surpasses the capabilities of generic pre-trained models, particularly for challenging scenarios involving varied fonts, handwritten text, and degraded image quality.

Second, the research focuses on developing and implementing advanced image preprocessing techniques that can significantly improve OCR accuracy across diverse input conditions. This includes the development of adaptive filtering algorithms, contrast enhancement methods, brightness adjustment techniques, and geometric correction procedures that are specifically optimized for integration with custom-trained OCR models. The preprocessing pipeline is designed to handle real-world image variations including poor lighting conditions, perspective distortions, and image artifacts.

Third, the work addresses the challenge of transforming raw OCR output into semantically rich and contextually appropriate prompts suitable for high-quality image generation. This involves the local deployment and optimization of the GPT-OSS-20B model using the Ollama framework on macOS systems, development of effective prompt engineering strategies, and implementation of error correction mechanisms that can handle OCR inaccuracies and ambiguities in the extracted text.

Fourth, the research aims to establish an efficient and scalable system architecture that seamlessly integrates multiple AI components while maintaining real-time performance characteristics and user experience quality. This includes developing asynchronous processing workflows, implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, optimizing communication between different system components, and ensuring that the integrated system can handle the computational demands of multiple AI services operating concurrently.

Finally, the work seeks to conduct comprehensive evaluation and validation of the integrated system across multiple performance dimensions, including text extraction accuracy, prompt generation effectiveness, image synthesis quality, and overall user satisfaction. This evaluation framework provides critical insights into the strengths and limitations of the integrated approach and establishes benchmarks for future research in multimodal AI system development.
